# DininghallSurvey

Our dining hall survey web project offers a dual-pronged approach to enhance the dining experience.

For diners, it provides a user-friendly platform for rating meals and providing comments, fostering a responsive dining atmosphere.

On the administrative front, HR personnel have access to tools for uploading meal templates and organizing menu lists for various meal times such as breakfast, lunch, and evening meals. Additionally, a comprehensive result report page empowers HR to gain insights into meal performance based on user feedback.

Our system is committed to continuous development and improvement, contributing to elevated dining experiences and efficient meal management.


There are methods that need to be tested on each page. An Excel file has been prepared to show how these methods react after testing.
